DEBUG LOGS - Temporary debug traces

Files modified (temporary):
- containers/user_profile/user_profile_init.js

What I added:
- console.log traces prefixed with "DEBUG: USER_PROFILE" at module load, template fetch, template injection, open/close calls, save start, and dispatched events/errors.

Purpose:
- These logs help trace whether the profile init module is loaded, whether the template is fetched and inserted into the DOM, whether the `openUserProfile()` entrypoint is invoked, and whether saving completes.

How to remove these temporary logs later (recommended):
1) If you use git, the easiest way is to discard the changes to these files:
   git checkout -- containers/user_profile/user_profile_init.js
   (Repeat for any other files if modified.)

2) If you want to remove only the debug lines (PowerShell):
   # WARNING: review files before running; this removes lines that contain the exact marker string
   Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.js | ForEach-Object {
     $path = $_.FullName
     (Get-Content $path) | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch "DEBUG: USER_PROFILE" } | Set-Content $path
   }

3) Alternatively, restore from a clean commit or stash if you keep one.

Notes:
- I intentionally used a unique prefix ("DEBUG: USER_PROFILE") to make it straightforward to find and remove only the temporary logging lines.
- If you'd like, I can add a simple script `scripts/clear-debug-logs.ps1` that runs the PowerShell removal above and commit it (and remove it once you clear logs). Tell me if you want that.

Additional temporary logs added:
- containers/user_menu/user_menu_init.js
   - Added `DEBUG: USER_MENU` logs in the edit handler to trace invocation and whether `window.openUserProfile` is called.
   - Added a debug report after attaching listeners that logs presence of `#profile-edit-btn`, `#profile-settings-btn`, and `#profile-logout-btn`.
   - Added a delegated document click listener to detect clicks on `#profile-edit-btn` (helps when direct listeners fail).

How to remove these extra logs:
- Use `git checkout -- containers/user_menu/user_menu_init.js` to discard the change, or
- Remove lines containing the exact marker `DEBUG: USER_MENU` using the PowerShell snippet in this file.
